Generating the datasets for Exercise set 1 in classification

Due to some demand, here is an example in python of how to generate the datasets needed. Sorry for not providing a matlab version, but everything should be directly transferable

import numpy as np

variances = [0.25, 0.49, 1.0]

m1 = -1
m2 = 1

np.random.randn gives us values from a standard normal distribution. (Use randn in matlab) Scale by multiplying with the standard deviation and shift by adding the mean.

$X' = X \cdot \sigma + \mu$

# Run only once to generate and save datasets
for variance in variances:
    c1 = np.random.randn(1000) * np.sqrt(variance) + m1
    c2 = np.random.randn(1000) * np.sqrt(variance) + m2
    dataset = np.concatenate((c1, c2))
    
    np.savetxt(f'dataset_{variance}.txt', dataset)
